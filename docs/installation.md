# Installation: Setting Up Your Environment for ModernBERT üöÄ

This document provides step-by-step instructions for installing the necessary software and setting up your environment to use the `lightonai/modernbert-embed-large` model and other related tools.

---

## 1. Python Environment üêç

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with other projects. You can create a virtual environment using `venv` or `conda`.

**Using `venv`:**

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .ModernBERT

# Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
source .ModernBERT/bin/activate

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
.ModernBERT\Scripts\activate
```

**Using `conda`:**

```bash
# Create a conda environment
conda create -n modernbert-env python=3.9

# Activate the conda environment
conda activate modernbert-env
```

---

## 2. Install PyTorch üî•

ModernBERT relies on PyTorch. Install the appropriate version of PyTorch for your system, following the instructions on the official PyTorch website: [https://pytorch.org/](https://pytorch.org/)

**Example (for CUDA 11.8):**

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

**Note:** Choose the correct CUDA version if you have a compatible GPU. For CPU-only installation, use:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

---

## 3. Install Hugging Face Transformers ü§ó

The Hugging Face `transformers` library provides the necessary tools for using ModernBERT.

```bash
pip install transformers
```

---

## 4. Install Other Dependencies üì¶

Install the other required packages:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn datasets tqdm
```

**Optional Dependencies:**

-   **FAISS** (for efficient similarity search):
    ```bash
    pip install faiss-cpu # For CPU-only installation
    # or
    pip install faiss-gpu # For GPU installation (ensure you have the correct CUDA version)
    ```

-   **Plotly** (for interactive visualizations):
    ```bash
    pip install plotly
    ```

-   **UMAP** (for dimensionality reduction):
    ```bash
    pip install umap-learn
    ```
- **NLTK** (for text preprocessing):
    ```bash
    pip install nltk
    ```
- **SpaCy** (for text preprocessing):
    ```bash
    pip install spacy
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```

---

## 5. Test the Installation ‚úÖ

Verify that everything is installed correctly by running the following Python code:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
import torch

model_name = "lightonai/modernbert-embed-large"

# Load the tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Load the model
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Move the model to the GPU if available
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)

# Test with a simple input
text = "This is a test sentence."
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt").to(device)

with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

print("Installation successful!")
print(f"Output shape: {outputs.last_hidden_state.shape}")
```

If the code runs without errors and prints the output shape, your installation is successful.

## 6. (Optional) Install Additional Tools üß∞

-   **TensorBoard** (for visualizing training):
    ```bash
    pip install tensorboard
    ```

-   **ONNX Runtime** (for optimized inference):
    ```bash
    pip install onnxruntime onnxruntime-gpu # Use onnxruntime-gpu if you have a compatible GPU
    ```

-   **TensorRT** (for optimized inference on NVIDIA GPUs): Follow the instructions on the NVIDIA website to install TensorRT for your specific GPU and CUDA version.
