# ðŸ”§ Fine-Tuning ModernBERT for Custom Embeddings ðŸ”§

Fine-tuning ModernBERT for custom embeddings is an essential step when your task requires a specialized understanding of the text data, beyond what is captured by the pre-trained model. Fine-tuning allows ModernBERT to adapt to domain-specific tasks, such as legal text understanding, medical terminology, or customer support interactions.

This section covers the process of fine-tuning ModernBERT embeddings for custom use cases, including setup, training, and evaluation.

## Why Fine-Tune Embeddings?

The pre-trained embeddings from ModernBERT are generalized, meaning they capture broad semantic relationships but might not specialize in niche domains or specific tasks. Fine-tuning allows the model to:
- **Improve Task-Specific Performance**: Adjust the embeddings to better suit the characteristics of your data.
- **Adapt to New Vocabulary**: Learn new vocabulary or domain-specific terms.
- **Increase Semantic Accuracy**: Enhance the modelâ€™s understanding of concepts that are important for your application (e.g., specialized legal language).

Common use cases for fine-tuning include:
- **Sentiment Analysis**
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
- **Document Classification**
- **Custom Search Engines**

## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

Before fine-tuning, ensure that your environment is set up with the necessary dependencies. Below is an outline of what to install:

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install transformers datasets torch
pip install -U scikit-learn
```

The `transformers` library from Hugging Face provides access to the pre-trained ModernBERT model, while `datasets` is used to load and handle datasets. `torch` is needed for PyTorch-based model training.

---

## Step 2: Load the Pre-Trained ModernBERT Model

To fine-tune ModernBERT, you first need to load the pre-trained model from Hugging Face's model hub. This can be done as follows:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

# Load the pre-trained ModernBERT model and tokenizer
model_name = "lightonai/modernbert-embed-large"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=2)  # Example for binary classification
```

In this case, we are assuming a binary classification task, but you can adjust the `num_labels` parameter based on your task (e.g., multi-class classification or regression).

---

## Step 3: Prepare the Data

Fine-tuning requires a dataset in the appropriate format. The dataset should be a collection of text samples paired with labels (e.g., for classification tasks).

Hereâ€™s an example of how to load a custom dataset using the `datasets` library:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load your custom dataset or use a dataset from the Hugging Face hub
dataset = load_dataset("imdb")  # Example: IMDB movie reviews dataset
```

After loading the dataset, we need to tokenize it so that it can be fed into the model:

```python
# Tokenize the data
def tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples['text'], padding=True, truncation=True)

# Apply tokenization to the dataset
tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)
```

Ensure that your dataset is properly formatted for the task at hand, whether itâ€™s classification, regression, or any other NLP task.

---

## Step 4: Fine-Tune the Model

Fine-tuning the model involves training it on your specific dataset. The training loop is implemented using PyTorch and Hugging Face's `Trainer` API, which abstracts much of the boilerplate code for model training.

Here is an example of how to fine-tune the model on your dataset:

```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',          # Output directory
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",     # Evaluate every epoch
    learning_rate=2e-5,              # Learning rate
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,  # Batch size
    per_device_eval_batch_size=64,   # Evaluation batch size
    num_train_epochs=3,              # Number of training epochs
    weight_decay=0.01,               # Weight decay for regularization
    logging_dir='./logs',            # Directory for logs
)

# Initialize the Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,                         # The pre-trained model
    args=training_args,                  # Training arguments
    train_dataset=tokenized_datasets['train'],  # Training data
    eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets['test'],    # Evaluation data
)

# Start fine-tuning
trainer.train()
```

This will start the fine-tuning process. The model will adjust its weights based on the provided training data. After training, the model will be optimized for your task-specific embeddings.

---

## Step 5: Evaluate the Model

Once the model is fine-tuned, youâ€™ll want to evaluate its performance on the validation or test set to ensure that it is performing well on your specific task. Hereâ€™s how to evaluate it:

```python
# Evaluate the model
eval_results = trainer.evaluate()

print(f"Evaluation results: {eval_results}")
```

This will return evaluation metrics such as accuracy, loss, and any other metrics defined in the training arguments.

---

## Step 6: Save the Fine-Tuned Model

Once your fine-tuning is complete, save the model so that you can load it later for inference:

```python
# Save the model and tokenizer
model.save_pretrained("./fine_tuned_model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./fine_tuned_model")
```

This will save the model and tokenizer in a local directory for later use. You can load the fine-tuned model in the future by using:

```python
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("./fine_tuned_model")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("./fine_tuned_model")
```

---

## Step 7: Use Fine-Tuned Embeddings for Your Application

After fine-tuning, you can now use the model to generate embeddings specifically suited to your task. For example, if you're using it for semantic search or document classification, you can generate embeddings as shown below:

```python
# Example usage to generate embeddings for new text
new_text = "Fine-tuning is essential for improving model performance on custom tasks."
inputs = tokenizer(new_text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, padding=True)

# Get the embedding from the [CLS] token
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

embedding = outputs.last_hidden_state[:, 0, :].numpy()
```

This will provide you with embeddings that are fine-tuned for your specific domain or task.

## Visualizing Fine-Tuning Performance

To evaluate and visualize the performance of your fine-tuned model, you can plot training loss curves, accuracy over epochs, or the confusion matrix for classification tasks. Tools like **TensorBoard** or **Matplotlib** can be used for this.

Hereâ€™s a placeholder for an SVG figure to visualize the training loss curve:

## Best Practices for Fine-Tuning

Here are a few best practices to consider when fine-tuning ModernBERT embeddings:

1. **Early Stopping**: To avoid overfitting, monitor the validation loss and stop training when it stops improving.
2. **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Use learning rate schedules (e.g., `linear` decay) to gradually reduce the learning rate during training.
3. **Data Augmentation**: For small datasets, data augmentation techniques (e.g., paraphrasing, back-translation) can help improve model generalization.
